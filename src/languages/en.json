  "AboutMe": "I am a developer with experience in creating and maintaining web applications as well as process automation. For the past three years, I have been working with Intrexx and Electron.js, developing applications that integrate with OData services. In Intrexx, I have implemented server-side logic and dynamic views using Groovy and Velocity, while in Electron I have developed desktop applications integrated with other platforms. I have practical skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as experience with React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. Additionally, I create simple automations in Power Automate, and my personal projects allow me to further develop my practical skills and experiment with new technologies. I also have experience with platforms such as TrueNAS, Proxmox, and Docker, and I have been involved in setting up smaller services (e.g., Grafana) on Linux servers. I quickly learn new tools and technologies, which allows me to efficiently adapt to different environments and project requirements",
